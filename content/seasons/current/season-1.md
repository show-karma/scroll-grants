## Season 8 – Grants Council

The Grants Council is granting to projects that **increase adoption** in the Scroll ecosystem.

### Our Objective
Projects must target **one of the following metrics**:  
#### Total Value Locked (TVL)  
- **Why it matters:** TVL represents supply for onchain economic activity.  
- **Formula:** ΔTVL = (Tokens_end − Tokens_start) × Price_end 
#### Transaction Fees  
- **Why it matters:** Fees measure demand for transacting and willingness to pay.  
- **Formula:**  ΔFees = Fees_end − Fees_start

Examples of eligible projects:
- Making assets in the Interop Set interop-ready  
- Upgrades or integrations that increase interop TVL  
- Applications or features that generate interop-enabled transactions  
- Moving TVL into interop-compatible formats  
- Tooling that tracks or increases adoption
