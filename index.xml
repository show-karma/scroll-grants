## How We Operate

The Scroll Grants operates through a structured process designed to ensure fair, transparent, and impactful grant allocation.

### Grant Seasons

We operate in seasons, typically lasting 3-4 months each. Each season has:
- Defined budget allocation
- Specific focus areas and priorities
- Clear application and review timelines
- Published results and impact reports

### Application Process

1. **Application Submission**: Projects submit detailed proposals during the open application period
2. **Initial Review**: Council members perform initial screening for eligibility and completeness
3. **Deep Dive Analysis**: Promising proposals receive thorough evaluation
4. **Community Input**: Select proposals are shared for community feedback
5. **Final Decision**: Council votes on grant allocations
6. **Public Announcement**: All decisions are published transparently

### Evaluation Criteria

We evaluate proposals based on:
- **Impact Potential**: How significantly will this benefit the Scroll ecosystem?
- **Team Capability**: Does the team have the skills and experience to deliver?
- **Technical Merit**: Is the approach sound and innovative?
- **Budget Efficiency**: Is the requested amount reasonable for the proposed outcomes?
- **Alignment**: Does it align with current season priorities?

### Post-Grant Support

- Regular milestone check-ins
- Technical and strategic guidance
- Connection to relevant resources and partners
- Public progress updates
- Impact measurement and reporting

### Transparency Commitments

- All grant decisions published publicly
- Regular council meeting summaries
- Open office hours for applicants
- Published evaluation rubrics
- Season retrospectives and learnings --&gt;</description></item><item><title/><link>https://grants.scroll.io/seasons/current/season-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://grants.scroll.io/seasons/current/season-1/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="season-8--grants-council"&gt;Season 8 â€“ Grants Council&lt;/h2&gt;
